I've decided to start a blog with [Github pages]({%http://pages.github.com%}) and [Octopress]({%http://octopress.org%}) The starting was seamless, except I've created github project with wrong name. If you get an "ERROR" when you deploy, then check the github project name: {%img right /images/post/github-error.png rake deploy error%}
