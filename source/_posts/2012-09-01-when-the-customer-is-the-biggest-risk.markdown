When I start a development project with my team, I get at least two constraints: deadline and fixed budget. In my experience, deadline is near and budget is low.

> So, there is no time to waste!

Using [lean](http://www.poppendieck.com) approach is the best way to the success. What does it mean to be lean? Check out [my lean presentation](http://prezi.com/cihxni4tajvj/lean-software-development/)

Sometimes I get more constraints from my customer, e.g: unfamiliar technology, customer's own framework, developing with non-teammate, obsolate code, etc. This looks like innocent, but it is a real threat to deadline and budget. I call them to _known constraints_.
<!-- more -->
In addition, sometimes there are _latent constraints_ on customer side:

* low workplace culture
* client is not committed
* no customer experiences in software development
* unreal budget

These _latent constraints_ are very important! My experience that, any of these will lead to failure. In that case, _the customer is the biggest risk_.

## Conclusion
Before you contract to a project consider the following viewpoints:

1. Project has a reasonable deadline.
1. The _known constraints_ are acceptable and you can meet these demands.
1. There isn't any _latent constraint_.

If you can say yes to all viewpoints, then start the project.
